<h1><i>Success</i></h1>
<p>As a mentor, people often come to me when they are overwhelmed, <b>stressed</b> and <strong>feeling</strong> like they’re not accomplishing their goals, the things they most want to do in life. They feel stuck. They are at a point which they don’t know what to do.
</p>
<h2>1. <em>Productive, successful people don’t get sucked into social media.</em></h2>
<p>Being on social media—checking notifications Facebook, scrolling through pictures on Instagram, reading quick updates on Twitter, whatever—it’s part of everyday life. But if you don’t control how much time you spend on it, the hours will fly by and you won’t have accomplished anything on your to-do list.So either put a time limit on it—set an alarm for when you need to minimize it, close the app, do something else—or only get on after completing necessary work projects. Use social media as a reward.

<h3><blockquote>2. Productive, successful people don’t go through the day without a plan.</blockquote></h3>
<p>Successful people have a <del>purpose</del> <ins>goal</ins>, a laser-focused <s>plan</s> goal of things they want to achieve on a particular day. <address> <q>I believe in writing things down </q> —but </address> only the top two or three priorities I need to accomplish that day, not a long list of things.Write down your top priorities and break down those large tasks into more reasonable steps and you’ll see yourself wanting to get them done and crossed off the list.</p>
